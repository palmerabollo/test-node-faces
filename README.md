node-faces
==========

This is a simple nodejs face detector.

It is based on opencv and uses websockets to send/receive images between the web clients and the nodejs backend.
It was created as a proof of concept to demo [Instant Servers](http://instantservers.telefonica.com) capabilities.

It works on Google Chrome but it should be easy to edit the HTML code in order to fix it.

Installation
