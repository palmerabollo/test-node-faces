node-faces
==========

This is a **simple nodejs face detector**. It is based on opencv and uses websockets to send/receive images between the web clients and the nodejs backend. It works on Google Chrome but it should be easy to edit the HTML code in order to fix it.

It was created as a proof of concept to demo [Instant Servers](http://instantservers.telefonica.com) capabilities.
